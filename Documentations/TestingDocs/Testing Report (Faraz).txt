Enter long text into memo title
	memo is posted with a very long title, unacceptable
	
Enter log user description for admin adding user
	if long enough, send message cannot be found. Height of window should not be too dynamic. Happened when pasting a youtube page.
	
When adding a user ID that is the same as another user, the other user is overwritten
this is very bad when there is only 1 admin and the admin deletes themself

When adding 2 users of different ID but same name and email but different password. They are both accepted but only the first one on the list accepts the password.

When copying and pasting youtube page into ID feild for adding user, it is initially accepted but when logging out and in, it does not exist anymore.
this is good...in a sense

however '.' is accepted into the ID field and should not be accepted.

is it possible to delete every user and then log out? if so this is a problem.

in htmleditor for memo:
	typing orange text will not be rendered  orange in the actual memo.
	
	when minimizing text area to smallest, cannot reopen text area

When viewing memos, if different tab is clicked the memo page changes but the selected memo stays the same
update: fixed in a sense	

When logging in as a user, the accepted string is strict:
-the email is case sensitive( which is okay )
-if space are entered, the login is incorrect if the intended login has no spaces( this is not as user friendly )

However login can handle extremely large inputs and catches when no string is entered for either email or password.

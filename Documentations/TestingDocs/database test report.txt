Test report for database.js

  Use a following object to test all functions in database.js
  docs = [
	{"author" : "John",
	"title" : "Subject",
	"created_at" : new Date(),
	"body" : "Test string",
	"comments" : []},
	
	{"author" : "Alex",
	"title" : "Second Subject",
	"created_at" : new Date(),
	"body" : "Example body",
	 "comments" : []}
  ];

- All functions in testDatabase.js work

- When you append something, target field has to have an array before you call function.
- Object ID has to be Hex string, instead of ObjectID object (the function creates it for you).
